## Nike+ Fuelband API
Version 1.0

This API allows you to query the Nike+ Website and get the latest full activity.

Latest full activity means that it always returns the second last day which has fuelpoint, because the fuelpoints for the newest day will never be the maximum fuelpoints earned this day.

# Usage
See example.php for some examples.

# Idea
Built for showing Fuelpoint data for each Amazee Labs Teammember on http://amazeelabs.com/team
